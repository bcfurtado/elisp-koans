** What is elisp-koans?
   
   =elisp-koans= helps you learn [[info:elisp:Introduction][Emacs Lisp]] (elisp) via test-driven development.
   You're provided with suites of tests describing components of the elisp
   syntax and environment. Fixing the tests leads you on a tutorial of elisp.
   
   These koans are for those learning to code in Emacs Lisp and customize Emacs.
   You should already be able to make your way around Emacs plus be able to
   call interactive functions, evaluate code in the buffer, and look up
   documentation.

** Usage

   Create a clone of this repository:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans
   #+END_SRC

   First load [[file:elisp-koans.el][elisp-koans.el]] by opening it in Emacs then running =eval-buffer=.

   Next open up [[file:koans/asserts.el::(elisp-koans/define-test][koans/asserts.el]] and navigate to the first test:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (elisp-koans/deftest
      elisp-koans/asserts-true ()
      "`t' is true. Replace the blank with `t' to assert it is true"
      (should ___))
   #+END_SRC

   Fix the test by replacing the blank (=___=) with the appropriate value, in
   this case =t= as described in the docstring:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (should t)
   #+END_SRC

   Once the test is fixed evaluate the test and then run it by calling
   =elisp-koans/run-test= and selecting the test: =elisp-koans/asserts-true=.
   ERT will run the test and report the result.

   You're ready to move on to the remaining koans in =koans/asserts.el= and
   beyond. The variable =elisp-koans-groups= lists the remaining suites of koans
   which are ordered to provide a tour of Emacs Lisp. As you progress run all of
   the loaded koans by calling =elisp-koans/run-tests=, or a single koan group
   by calling it interactively.

   To quickly load all of the tests call the interactive function
   =elisp-koans/load-groups=.
